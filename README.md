# Master-1-Numerical-Analysis-Fundamental-Mathematics-
This repository contains a collection of practical projects (*Travaux Pratiques*) carried out during my first year of Masterâ€™s degree in **Fundamental Mathematics**.   The focus is on **numerical methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**, with applications ranging from diffusion processes to nonlinear conservation laws.
